        Below you'll find some personal notes I write while learning math.

        Many "Chapters" were written long ago and need to be revised, both for typography as well as for style. For example, I recently changed the layout, and now there are many diagrams running off the page. I've tried adding an "Organisation" rating to them below, with 0 meaning a completely messy document, and 5 meaning one which is perfectly up to date with regards to organisation.

        In addition, the notes are very informal and contain many, many errors, so please use them at your own risk.

        Feel free to shoot me an email at (to be added) in case you find errors―from typos to more serious errors like wrong statements/proofs―or have any comments―from things like contributing proofs or pointers to them, answers to questions or conjectures inside the notes, or really just saying 'hi'―all of these and more are very welcome =)
